                <p>App Store Optimization (ASO) refers to improving an app's visibility and user appeal in the app stores and increasing app conversion rates to get more downloads. The most popular app stores are App Store for iOS apps and Google Play Store for Android apps.</p>
                <p>In addition to ranking high in the app store search results, ASO also focuses on click-through rate (CTR). To optimize for high CTR, you must convince people to click on your app store listing once they find it. Typical CTR optimization includes your app name, app title, app icon, app screenshots, and app ratings.</p>
                <p>In this in-depth and extensive guide, we share all the tips and tricks you need to know to succeed at app store optimization. If you are unfamiliar with ASO or are just getting started, you will find here all the information to start ranking your app higher in app stores.</p>
                <h2 id="why-is-app-store-optimization-important-for-app-growth">Why is app store optimization important for app growth?</h2>
                <p>According to Statista, there were&nbsp; <strong>3.3 million apps in Google Play Store</strong>&nbsp;by the end of Q1 in 2022. The same source reported that&nbsp; <strong>over 2.1 million apps were available in Apple’s App Store</strong>&nbsp;in the same period. With more than 5.4 million apps listed in the two largest app stores, achieving and holding high app rankings is becoming very challenging. </p>
                <p>Getting app downloads and growing your user base are among the most important KPIs for app marketers and publishers. There are two main ways how you can get those downloads:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>By running paid app campaigns that come with a certain cost-per-install (CPI)</li>
                  <li>By optimizing your app for organic traffic by following ASO best practices</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="wp-block-spacer" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</div>
                <p>Both tactics are essential for app growth, and advanced app marketers use them simultaneously for maximum impact. However, paid advertising comes with investment and can be challenging to pull off when you start your app journey. App store optimization is also not free but is the fundamental aspect you need to master to ensure the long-term success of your app.</p>
                <p>There are many ASO goals, but the primary one is to increase the number of downloads and the number of loyal users. Before jumping into the details, let’s first quickly explore the benefits of ASO.</p>
